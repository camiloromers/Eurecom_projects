    "# Challenge: What is the future selling price of a home?\n",
    "\n",
    "A home is often the largest and most expensive purchase a person makes in his or her lifetime. Ensuring homeowners have a trusted way to monitor this asset is incredibly important.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, students are required to develop a full-fledged approach to make predictions about the future sale prices of homes. A full-fledged approach constist, at least, in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Descriptive statistics about the data\n",
    "* Data cleaning and pre-processing\n",
    "* Defining a modeling approach to the problem\n",
    "* Build such a statistical model\n",
    "* Validate the outcome of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, should you ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, they probably wouldn't begin with describing features such as the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to a railroad. As you will see, the dataset we use in this competition proves that many more features influence price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.\n",
    "\n",
    "With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in a small city in the US, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home."
